  <h1>Welcome to the Elements Homepage</h1>
  <p>This is the homepage for our academic project, called Elements, where you can find information about our research and the progress we have made so far. 
    A paper describing Elements in depth, can be found <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07691.pdf">here</a>. The documentation of the 
    project can be found <a href="https://elementsproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">here</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Elements introduces for the first time the power of the Entity-Component-System (ECS) with the versatility of
  Scenegraphs, in the context of Computer Graphics (CG), Deep Learning (DL) for Scientific Visualization (SciViz). It also
  aims to provide the basic tools to anyone that wants to be involved with basic Computer Graphics as well as advanced
  topics such as Geometric Deep Learning, Geometric Algebra and many many more. </p>
  <p>Following a modern educational approach, all related packages are in the Python programming language.</p>
  
  <h2>Packages included in Elements</h2>
  The main Elements documentation is provided <a href="https://elementsproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">here</a>
  <ul>
    <li>pyECSS: A Python package for powerful Entity-Components-Systems in a Scenegraph </li>
    <li>pyGLV: A Python package applying ECSS to CG, Deep Learning and Scientific Visualisation oriented examples  </li>
    <li>pyEEL: An information hub for various topics where ECSS can be applied</li>
  </ul>
