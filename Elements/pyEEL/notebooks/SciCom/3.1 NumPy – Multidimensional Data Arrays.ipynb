    "A NumPy array is a multidimensional array of objects all of the same type. In memory, it is an object which points to a block of memory, keeps track of the type of data stored in that memory, keeps track of how many dimensions there are and how large each one is, and - importantly - the spacing between elements along each axis."

   "source": [
    "For example, you might have a NumPy array that represents the numbers from zero to nine, stored as 32-bit integers, one right after another, in a single block of memory (for comparison, each Python integer needs to have some type information stored alongside it). You might also have the array of even numbers from zero to eight, stored in the same block of memory, but with a gap of four bytes (one 32-bit integer) between elements. This is called **striding**, and it means that you can often create a new array referring to a subset of the elements in an array without copying any data. Such subsets are called **views**. This is an efficiency gain, obviously, but it also allows modification of selected elements of an array in various ways."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "An important constraint on NumPy arrays is that for a given axis, all the elements must be spaced by the same number of bytes in memory. NumPy cannot use double-indirection to access array elements, so indexing modes that would require this must produce copies. This constraint makes it possible for all the inner loops in NumPy’s internals to be written in efficient C code."

    "You may be wondering: why use `numpy` over Python lists, which seem to allow achieving the same thing? Python’s lists are efficient general-purpose containers. They support (fairly) efficient insertion, deletion, appending, and concatenation, and Python’s list comprehensions make them easy to construct and manipulate. "

    "However, they have certain limitations: they don’t support _vectorized_ operations like elementwise addition and multiplication, and the fact that they can contain objects of differing types mean that Python must store type information for every element, and must execute type dispatching code when operating on each element. This also means that very few list operations can be carried out by efficient C loops — each iteration would require type checks and other Python API bookkeeping."
