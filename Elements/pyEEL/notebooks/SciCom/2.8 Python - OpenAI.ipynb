      "To create a system for 3D character animation using pyECSS and pyGLV, you can follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Import the necessary packages:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from pyECSS import System\n",
      "from pyGLV import RenderMesh, BasicTransform\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Create a new class for your animation system that inherits from the `System` class:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "class CharacterAnimationSystem(System):\n",
      "    def __init__(self):\n",
      "        super().__init__()\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Implement the `update` method in your system class. This method will be called every frame to update the character's animation:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "    def update(self, dt):\n",
      "        # Get all entities with the required components\n",
      "        entities = self.get_entities_with_components(RenderMesh, BasicTransform)\n",
      "\n",
      "        # Update the animation for each entity\n",
      "        for entity in entities:\n",
      "            render_mesh = entity.get_component(RenderMesh)\n",
      "            transform = entity.get_component(BasicTransform)\n",
      "\n",
      "            # Perform animation calculations and update the render mesh and transform properties accordingly\n",
      "            # Example:\n",
      "            render_mesh.animation_frame += 1\n",
      "            transform.rotation += 0.1\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Create an instance of your animation system and add it to your pyECSS scenegraph:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "animation_system = CharacterAnimationSystem()\n",
      "scene.add_system(animation_system)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Run your pyECSS scenegraph update loop to continuously update the animation:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "while True:\n",
      "    dt = # calculate the time since the last frame\n",
      "    scene.update(dt)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: The code example provided is a basic implementation to give you an idea of how to create a system for 3D character animation using pyECSS and pyGLV. You will need to customize it according to your specific requirements and the structure of your character animation data.\n"
