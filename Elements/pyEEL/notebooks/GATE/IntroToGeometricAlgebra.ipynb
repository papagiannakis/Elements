    "The current state-of-the-art regarding virtual character rendering, animation, interpolation and deformation is dual quaternions [1](#1). Using dual quaternions allows translations of points and rotations (with respect to any axis, even the ones not going through the origin) to be applied in a single framework and with great efficiency. It also helps avoid problems such as the gimbals lock that arise when using Euler angles and provides an elegant representation of rigid motions if seen as a rotation followed by a translation (often called *screw motion* [2](#2)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Dual quaternions are the combination of dual numbers (introduced by Clifford) with quaternions (nicely written  introduction in [4](#4) and [3](#3)). This fusion allowed the implementation of translations under a single framework (see [3](#3)). Such a task was not possible before via the use of quaternions alone; it also required the use of matrices and/or vectors. This combined use of quaternions and matrices also required translating quaternions to vectors and vice-versa, which induced more memory usage and created major interpolation problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "An algebra that contains dual quaternions as a sub-algebra is the so called Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA). In CGA two new products are introduced: the *outer* and the *geometric* one. Entities such as spheres, planes, circles, points are easily seen both as objects and operators in this algebra (see [6](#6) and [7](#7)). In this algebra, we can interpolate around any axis and transform all entities as objects and not simply point by point. \n",

    "A major drawback of dual quaternions is the fact that they do not support scaling in a native way. This drawback can be overcome with the use of Geometric Algebra and specifically Conformal Geometric Algebra (see [7,8]). CGA contains both quaternion and dual-quaternion algebras as sub-algebras with the main difference that (dual) quaternion multiplication is replaced by the so-called *geometric product*. Therefore, after translating all dual quaternions to the respective elements of CGA, called *multivectors*, one can take advantage of all tools provided by quaternions. The translation is naive as we simply have to translate all base elements of one algebra to another, as shown in the following table:\n",

Rotors and rigid movements that corresponded to quaternions and dual quaternions respectively can also be represented as multivectors. Most importantly, dilations can also be represented as multivectors. Ultimately, \n",
    "if $D$ represents a deformation (rotor, motor, dilation or any combination of these three) in CGA and $E$ is any of the aforementioned entities in CGA, the new entity $E':=DE\\tilde{D}$, where $\\tilde{D}$ is the *reverse* of $D$, is the entity that results after applying $D$ to $E$. Note that the operation implied between $D$, $E$ and $\\tilde{D}$ is the geometric product of multivectors. In the reverse of a multivector the blades are with reversed order of their outer product components, for instance the reverse of $1 + e_1\\wedge e_2$ is equal to $1+e_2\\wedge e_1$ or $1-e_1\\wedge e_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to apply rotations, translations and dilation in a uniform way in so many entities, and not just points, is an extraordinary tool. It saves us from the need to translate our objects back and forth from dual quaternionic form to matrices and provides a straightforward way to apply any deformation in a way that easily encapsulates all corresponding information. Furthermore, interpolations can be easily defined and also include interpolation on axis that do not go throught the origin, which is a major restriction in dual quaternions. \n",
