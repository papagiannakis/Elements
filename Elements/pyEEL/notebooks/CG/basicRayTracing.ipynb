    "# what is row-major order for storage?\n",
    "Row-major order is a method of storing or accessing multidimensional arrays in memory. In this method, the elements in each row of the array are stored in consecutive memory locations. This means that when you iterate over the array, you will first go through all the elements in the first row, from left to right, then move on to the second row, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of pixel data, an image can be thought of as a 2D array (or a 3D array for color images), where each element of the array represents a pixel. If the pixel data is stored in row-major order, this means that the pixels are stored or accessed row by row. The top row of pixels (row 0) is stored first, followed by the second row (row 1), and so on. Within each row, the pixels are stored from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure illustrates the concept of row-major order for a `w by h` image, where `w` is the width of the image and `h` is the height of the image and the pixel data is stored in row-major order. The numbers represent the order in which the pixels are stored in memory, with the first pixel at the top left and the last pixel at the bottom right. Typically we use indices like **`i` for the columns** and **`j` for the rows**, so the pixel at row `i` and column `j` is stored at position `i * w + j` in the memory.\n",

    "- It sets the image `image_width` and `image_height`.\n",
    "- It opens a new file `output.ppm`` to write the image data.\n",
    "- It writes the header for the PPM file format.\n",
    "- It then iterates over each pixel in the image, calculating the *red (r)* and *green (g)* components based on the pixel's position. The *blue* component *(b)* is set to 0.\n",
    "- It **converts** these *floating-point* color values to **integers** in the **range 0 to 255**.\n",

    "-\n",
    "When this script is run, it will create a file named `output.ppm`` which will contain the image data in the PPM format, producing a gradient image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conversion of the color values to integers between 0 and 255 in the given code is a crucial step for representing colors in digital images, especially in formats like PPM (Portable Pixmap). Here's an explanation of how this conversion works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fractional Color Values**: Initially, the color values (`r`, `g`, and `b`) are calculated as fractions. These fractions represent how \"intense\" or \"bright\" the color is. A value of 0 means no intensity (black), and a value close to 1 means full intensity. For example, in the code, `r` and `g` values vary from 0 to almost 1 across the width and height of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scaling to 0-255 Range**: Most digital images use 8 bits per color channel, which allows for 256 different levels of intensity per channel (from 0 to 255). To convert a fractional intensity value to this range, it is multiplied by the maximum intensity level (255). However, to ensure the maximum fractional value (just below 1) maps correctly to 255, the multiplier is slightly less than 256, often chosen as 255.999. This adjustment helps in rounding off the values correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conversion to Integer**: \n",
    "   - After multiplication, the resulting value is in the range from 0 to 255.999.\n",
    "   - This value is then converted to an integer. In C++, the `static_cast<int>()` is used, and in Python, this is done simply by using `int()`. This step truncates (or effectively rounds down) the decimal part, resulting in an integer value in the desired range of 0 to 255.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Application in the Code**: \n",
    "   - In the context of the code, each pixel's color intensity for red (`r`) and green (`g`) is calculated based on its position.\n",
    "   - `r` varies horizontally, and `g` varies vertically. The blue component (`b`) is set to 0, which means there will be no blue intensity in any pixel.\n",
    "   - These values are then scaled and converted to integers, giving us the appropriate red and green color values for each pixel to be written in the PPM file.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Print progress indicator**:\n",
    "   - This Python code uses f-string formatting to embed the expression `image_height - j` within the string. The `end=' '` argument replaces the default newline character that `print` adds to the end of its output with a space. The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is flushed (i.e., immediately written) to the terminal, which is the equivalent of `std::flush` in C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "By performing this conversion for each pixel, the code effectively generates the color information for an entire image, where each pixel's color is represented by a set of three integers (representing the red, green, and blue channels) in the range of 0 to 255.\n",
    "\n",
    "> As described, the image shows a gradient:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **red component (R)** increases from *left to right*.\n",
    "- The **green component (G)** increases from *top to bottom*.\n",
    "- The **blue component (B)** is consistently zero across the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in a color transition from black at the top-left corner (where both R and G are zero) to yellow at the bottom-right corner (where both R and G are at their maximum, with no blue component)."

    "## 3. The vec3 class\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a basic vec3 type like the one in the C++ book. Following Python traditions, class members are not encaspsulated with getters/setters (if needed, you can always turn them into properties later, without breaking backward compatibility). We also add a few useful methods, that will allow us to use the Vec3 almost as if it was a regular numpy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all graphics programs have some class(es) for storing geometric vectors and colors. In many systems thesevectors are 4D (3D position plus a homogeneous coordinate for geometry, or RGB plus an alpha transparencycomponent for colors). For our purposes, three coordinates suffice. We’ll use the same class vec3 for colors,locations, directions, offsets, whatever. Some people don’t like this because it doesn’t prevent you from doingsomething silly, like subtracting a position from a color. They have a good point, but we’re going to always take the“less code” route when not obviously wrong. In spite of this, we do declare two aliases for vec3: point3 and color.Since these two types are just aliases for vec3, you won't get warnings if you pass a color to a function expecting apoint3, and nothing is stopping you from adding a point3 to a color, but it makes the code a little bit easier to readand to understand."
