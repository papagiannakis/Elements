    1. I have a BasicTransform component that has a TRS matrix and a l2worldTRS matrix
    2. For each BasicTransform component, I calculate the l2worldTRS matrix of that component based on the hierarchy of its parent nodes
    3. Then I update the l2worldTRS matrix of that BasicTransform component
    4. The l2worldTRS matrix of a component is calculated in the following way:
        a. if the component is the root node, then the l2worldTRS matrix is the TRS matrix of that component
        b. if the component is not the root node, then the l2worldTRS matrix is calculated by multiplying the TRS matrix of that component with the l2worldTRS matrix of its parent node
